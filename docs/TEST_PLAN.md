# 🧪 Complete Test Plan

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### 1. **3D Face Visualization Using Your Photos** 
✅ **Before**: Just a simple sphere/circle  
✅ **Now**: Your actual face structure made of audio waveforms!

**How it works:**
- Sends your 5 photos to Claude Vision API
- Claude analyzes facial features (eyes, nose, mouth, outline)
- Extracts 3D contour points for each feature
- Renders as animated waveform lines in 3D space

### 2. **Emotion-Based Color Changes**
✅ Colors change based on response emotion:
- 🔴 Red → Anger
- 🟠 Orange → Concern  
- 🟡 Yellow → Joy
- 🔵 Blue → Sadness
- 🟣 Purple → Fear
- 🟢 Green → Excited
- 🔵 Cyan → Neutral (default)

### 3. **Comprehensive Debug Logging**
✅ Every step now logs:
- Server-side logs (in terminal where `npm run dev` runs)
- Client-side logs (browser console)
- Helps identify exactly where issues occur

## 🧪 Test Flow

### **Step 1: Create Your Clone**

1. **Record Audio** (20 seconds)
   - Click "Start Recording"
   - You'll see a random prompt to guide you
   - Timer counts down from 20
   - Should auto-stop at 0
   - See waveform visualization

2. **Take 5 Photos**
   - Click "Start Taking Photos"
   - Camera preview shows clearly (not black)
   - Follow instructions:
     - Front: Look straight ahead
     - Left: Turn left
     - Right: Turn right  
     - Up: Look up
     - Down: Look down
   - Click camera button to capture each
   - Preview should stay active between shots

3. **Fill Context Form**
   - Add stories, habits, reactions
   - Click "Create My Clone"

4. **Wait for Processing**
   - "Analyzing face structure..." message
   - Takes ~3-5 seconds
   - Claude Vision is analyzing your photos

---

### **Step 2: Verify Face Visualization**

**Terminal should show:**
```
POST /api/analyze-face 200 in XXXXms
```

**Browser should show:**
- 3D face made of glowing waveform lines
- Face outline (large ellipse)
- Two eyes
- Two eyebrows
- Nose line
- Mouth curve
- Particles floating around
- Slow auto-rotation

**If you see "Analyzing face structure..." for too long:**
- Check terminal for errors
- Check `.env` has `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- Mock data will be used as fallback

---

### **Step 3: Test Chat - Neutral Response**

**Send this message:**
> "Tell me about yourself"

**What should happen:**

1. **Browser Console:**
   ```
   💬 Sending message: Tell me about yourself
   ```

2. **Terminal (Server):**
   ```
   🎙️ Speak API called
   📥 Request body: {userId: "...", message: "Tell me about yourself"}
   🔍 Looking up user: ...
   ✅ User found
   🧠 Querying memories...
   ✅ Found X relevant memories
   🤖 Generating Claude response...
   ✅ Claude response generated: Hi! I'm...
   🎤 Generating voice...
   ✅ Voice generated: /uploads/.../response.mp3
   💾 Storing in memory...
   ✅ Stored in memory
   🎉 Response complete!
   POST /api/speak 200 in XXXXms
   ```

3. **Browser Console:**
   ```
   ✅ Received response: {text: "...", audioUrl: "..."}
   🎭 Detected emotion: neutral
   🔊 Playing audio: ...
   ```

4. **Visual:**
   - Response appears in chat
   - Face stays **cyan** (neutral)
   - Waveforms **pulse intensely**
   - Audio plays (if Fish Audio configured)

---

### **Step 4: Test Emotions**

Try these scenarios to test different colors:

#### 🔴 Test Anger (Red)
**Message:**
> "Someone cuts you off in traffic right in front of you. How would you respond?"

**Expected:**
- Response includes words like "angry", "mad", or "furious"
- Console: `🎭 Detected emotion: anger`
- Face turns **RED**
- Waveforms pulse with angry intensity

#### 🟠 Test Concern (Orange)
**Message:**
> "Your friend seems really anxious about an upcoming exam. What would you say?"

**Expected:**
- Response includes "worried", "concerned", "anxious"
- Console: `🎭 Detected emotion: concern`
- Face turns **ORANGE**

#### 🟡 Test Joy (Yellow)
**Message:**
> "You just got accepted to your dream school! How do you celebrate?"

**Expected:**
- Response includes "happy", "excited", "joy"
- Console: `🎭 Detected emotion: joy`
- Face turns **YELLOW**

#### 🔵 Test Sadness (Blue)
**Message:**
> "You hear your friend's pet passed away. How do you respond?"

**Expected:**
- Response includes "sad", "sorry", "down"
- Console: `🎭 Detected emotion: sadness`
- Face turns **BLUE**

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Guide

### ❌ Problem: Face Not Showing

**Symptoms:**
- "Analyzing face structure..." stuck forever
- OR blank/black screen
- OR error in console

**Check:**

1. **Terminal logs:**
   ```
   POST /api/analyze-face 200
   ```
   If missing → API didn't run

2. **Browser console:**
   - Look for Three.js errors
   - Look for "Face contours loaded"

3. **Solutions:**
   - Verify `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env`
   - Try refreshing page
   - Check Chrome (best WebGL support)
   - Mock face data should still work if API fails

---

### ❌ Problem: No Chat Response

**Symptoms:**
- Message sends but no response
- Loading forever
- Error message

**Check Terminal First:**

1. **Do you see:**
   ```
   🎙️ Speak API called
   ```
   - **NO** → Request never reached server
     - Check browser console for network errors
     - Verify userId in sessionStorage
   - **YES** → Continue debugging

2. **Next line:**
   ```
   🔍 Looking up user: xxx
   ✅ User found
   ```
   - If you see `❌ User not found` → Database issue
   - Solution: Refresh and recreate clone

3. **Memory query:**
   ```
   🧠 Querying memories...
   ✅ Found X relevant memories
   ```
   - Warning is OK, not critical

4. **Claude response:**
   ```
   🤖 Generating Claude response...
   ✅ Claude response generated: ...
   ```
   - **If stuck here** → Claude API issue
   - Check `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env`
   - Check terminal for error details

5. **Voice generation:**
   ```
   🎤 Generating voice...
   ✅ Voice generated: ...
   ```
   - OK if it says "No audio (Fish API not configured)"
   - Text still works without voice

6. **Final:**
   ```
   🎉 Response complete!
   ```

**If you see:**
```
❌❌❌ Speak API error: ...
```
- Read the error details
- Common issues:
  - API key missing/invalid
  - Database connection lost
  - Network timeout

---

### ❌ Problem: No Audio

**Symptoms:**
- Chat works, text appears
- Face animates
- But no sound

**This is OK!**
- Voice is optional
- Text responses work without it

**To fix:**
1. Check terminal:
   ```
   🎤 Generating voice...
   ✅ Voice generated: /uploads/.../response.mp3
   ```

2. If it says "No audio (Fish API not configured)":
   - Add `FISH_AUDIO_API_KEY` to `.env`
   - Or continue without voice

3. If audio URL is present but no sound:
   - Check browser console for audio errors
   - Check browser audio permissions
   - Try another browser

---

### ❌ Problem: Wrong Colors

**Symptoms:**
- Face stays cyan despite emotional response
- Color doesn't match emotion

**This is expected!**
- Emotion detection is keyword-based
- Simple pattern matching
- May not detect subtle emotions

**To improve:**
1. Use more explicit emotional words in scenarios
2. Check console: `🎭 Detected emotion: ...`
3. Add more keywords to `detectEmotion()` function

---

### ❌ Problem: Waveforms Not Pulsing

**Symptoms:**
- Face shows but doesn't animate
- Lines are static

**Check:**
1. Browser console:
   ```
   🔊 Playing audio: ...
   ▶️ Video playing
   ```

2. Is `isPlaying` true?
   - Check React DevTools
   - Should be true during audio playback

3. Is `audioData` populated?
   - Should be array of numbers
   - Check in React DevTools

**Solutions:**
- Ensure audio is actually playing
- Check Web Audio API setup
- Try playing audio manually

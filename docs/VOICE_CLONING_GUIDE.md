# 🎤 Fish Audio Voice Cloning - How It Works

## ✅ **CUSTOM VOICE CLONING NOW IMPLEMENTED!**

Your AI clone will now speak with **YOUR ACTUAL VOICE** using Fish Audio's on-the-fly voice cloning technology.

---

## 🔧 **How It Works**

### **Previous Approach (FAILED)**
- ❌ Tried to create persistent voice models via `/model` endpoint
- ❌ Complex multi-step process with training
- ❌ Undocumented API parameters
- ❌ 60-90 second wait times

### **New Approach (WORKING!)**
- ✅ **On-the-fly voice cloning** - no model creation needed!
- ✅ Your 20-second recording is sent with **every TTS request** as a "reference"
- ✅ Fish Audio clones your voice in real-time (2-3 seconds)
- ✅ No training, no waiting, no model storage

---

## 📋 **Voice Recording Requirements**

For best voice cloning quality, your 20-second recording should:

1. **Clear Speech** - Speak clearly and naturally
2. **Minimal Background Noise** - Record in a quiet environment
3. **Consistent Volume** - Don't whisper or shout
4. **Natural Tone** - Use your normal speaking voice
5. **Complete Sentences** - Follow the prompts provided

**The app automatically guides you with prompts like:**
- "Describe what you did today"
- "Talk about your favorite hobby"
- "Tell a short story about something funny"

---

## 🔬 **Technical Implementation**

### **API Flow:**

```
User chats with clone
    ↓
Claude generates personality-matched response
    ↓
Fish Audio TTS Request (multipart/form-data):
  - text: "Response text to speak"
  - reference_audio: [Your 20-second recording]
  - reference_text: "" (optional transcript)
  - format: "mp3"
    ↓
Fish Audio returns cloned voice audio (2-3 seconds)
    ↓
Audio plays automatically in browser
```

### **Code Changes:**

**`app/api/speak/route.ts`:**
- Uses `multipart/form-data` instead of JSON
- Sends user's `recording.webm` as `reference_audio` attachment
- Falls back to default voice if user audio not available

**`app/api/upload/route.ts`:**
- Removed the 90-second voice model training step
- Upload completes in seconds, not minutes

## 🧪 **Testing Voice Cloning**

### **Test 1: Verify Audio Recording Saved**
```bash
# Check your recording exists
ls -lh public/uploads/*/recording.webm

# Should show: recording.webm with ~200-500KB size
```

### **Test 2: Test Fish Audio API Directly**
```bash
cd /Users/felixfan/Documents/Academia/Hackathons/CalHacks

# Run the test script
./test_fish_with_reference.sh

# Should output: "✅ Generated audio: ~40-50KB"
# Audio saved to: /tmp/test_clone_output.mp3
```

**Play the test audio:**
```bash
# macOS
open /tmp/test_clone_output.mp3

# Or drag it into your browser
```

### **Test 3: Full App Test**

1. **Start fresh:**
```bash
# Delete old data
rm -rf public/uploads/*
rm prisma/dev.db

# Regenerate database
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
```

2. **Record new audio:**
   - Go to http://localhost:3002
   - Record 20 seconds (speak clearly!)
   - Take 5 photos
   - Provide personality context

3. **Chat with your clone:**
   - Go to chat page
   - Send a message
   - **Listen to the voice** - it should sound like YOU!

---

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### **Voice sounds like default template:**

**Check 1: Audio file exists?**
```bash
ls -lh public/uploads/*/recording.webm
```
If missing, re-record from step 1.

**Check 2: API key valid?**
```bash
# Test API key
curl -X POST "https://api.fish.audio/v1/tts" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -F "text=test" \
  -F "format=mp3" \
  -w "\nStatus: %{http_code}\n"
```
Should return `Status: 200` and audio data.

**Check 3: Check browser console logs:**
- Open DevTools → Console
- Look for: `"🎤 Using custom voice from: ..."`
- Should show: `"✅ Using custom voice cloning with uploaded audio"`

**Check 4: Check terminal logs:**
```
📤 Calling Fish Audio TTS with custom voice cloning...
🎤 Using custom voice from: /path/to/recording.webm
✅ Using custom voice cloning with uploaded audio
✅ Fish Audio TTS response: 200 45678 bytes
💾 Audio saved: /uploads/.../response_xxx.mp3
```

### **Voice quality is poor:**

1. **Re-record in a quiet environment**
2. **Speak more clearly and naturally**
3. **Ensure your mic is working properly**
4. **Record a longer sample** (up to 30 seconds is supported)

### **"No audio generated":**

1. **Check Fish Audio credits:**
   - Go to https://fish.audio/
   - Check your account balance
   - Each TTS costs ~$0.01-0.03

2. **Check API key permissions:**
   - Ensure API key has TTS access enabled

---

## 💰 **Cost Breakdown**

- **Voice Model Creation:** $0 (using on-the-fly cloning)
- **Per TTS Request:** ~$0.01-0.03 per message
- **For Hackathon Demo:** ~$1-2 total (50-100 messages)

**With $5 credits, you can have ~200+ conversations!**

## 📊 **Performance Metrics**

| Metric | Time |
|--------|------|
| Upload + Recording | ~30 seconds |
| Face Analysis | ~2-5 seconds |
| Personality Processing | ~1-3 seconds |
| **Total Setup** | **~45 seconds** |
| Per Message (text) | ~1-2 seconds |
| Per Message (voice) | ~2-4 seconds |
| **Total Response** | **~5 seconds** |

---

## 🎯 **Key Advantages**

✅ **Instant Setup** - No 90-second voice training
✅ **True Voice Cloning** - Uses YOUR actual recording
✅ **High Quality** - Fish Audio's state-of-the-art TTS
✅ **Automatic Fallback** - Uses default voice if needed
✅ **Cost Effective** - No model storage fees

---

## 🚀 **Demo Tips**

When demoing at the hackathon:

1. **Record in a quiet space** before the presentation
2. **Test the voice** before going on stage
3. **Have a backup** - default voice works if custom fails
4. **Emphasize the tech:**
   - "The AI clone speaks with MY voice!"
   - "It clones my personality AND voice in real-time!"
   - "Watch how it matches my angry tone..."

## 📝 **Next Steps**

Optional enhancements:
- [ ] Add "Record New Voice" button on chat page
- [ ] Show voice cloning status indicator
- [ ] Add voice quality meter during recording
- [ ] Support multiple language voice cloning
- [ ] Add prosody controls (speed, pitch, emotion)

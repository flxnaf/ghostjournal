## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Build Issues

**Error: "Could not resolve dependencies"**

- Check: `java -version`

### Runtime Issues

**Mod doesn't load:**
- Check `.minecraft/logs/latest.log`
- Ensure Fabric Loader 0.15.0+ installed
- Install Fabric API and Fabric Language Kotlin

**Spawn egg not in creative menu:**
- Restart Minecraft
- Check "Tools" creative tab
- Look for "Twin Spawn Egg"

**GUI doesn't open:**
- Check server logs for errors
- Ensure client and server both loaded mod
- Try `/twinimport` first to ensure twin data exists

**Voice doesn't play:**
- Check console for "Audio playback failed"
- Verify `/api/speak` returns valid `audioUrl`
- Test audio URL directly in browser
- Check audio output device

**Entity has no AI:**
- Entity should walk around randomly
